# Dark Souls 1

## Humanity
Rare tiny black sprite found on corpses. Use to gain 1 humanity and restore a large amount of HP. This black sprite is called humanity, but little is known about its true nature. If the soul is the source of all life, then what distinguishes the humanity we hold within ourselves?

## Ricard's Rapier
A rapier with intricate decorations. Chosen weapon of the infamous Undead Prince Ricard. Ricard's exploirts are told in a monomyth. He was born into royalty, but wandered the lands in a fateful ill-conceived journey. He became Undead, and disappeared up North.

## Butcher Knife
Giant butcher knife wielded by the Undead man-eating cook lurking in the Depths. More a tool for subduing and preparing live catches than an actual weapon. Those who have faced this deadly blade have a deeper sense of how helpless prey must feel.

## Lifehunt Scythe
Scythe born from the soul of Priscilla, the stark white crossbreed trapped inside the Painted World of Ariamis. Even the Gods feared Priscilla's lifehunt ability, and in the hands of a mortal, its power will turn upon its wielder.

## Dark Hand
The Darkwraiths, incited by Kaathe, use the power of the dark soul to absorb humanity, an art shared by this weapon, which also acts as a special shield. The ancients, particularly, could sap the humanity of even a replete saint in the blink of an eye.

## Demon's Catalyst
Demon catalyst formed from Izalith molten rock. Can be used as fire weapon. The Demon Firesage was the first demon, and the last master of the original fire arts, before the Witch of Izalith was engulfed by Chaos, creating pyromancy.

## Izalith Catalyst
Catalyst of the Witch of Izalith of long ago, when her daughters were still flame witches, before they were engulfed by the Chaos Flame. Before the birth of pyromancy, their wands were mediums for sorcery, but knowledge of this flame sorcery has long since vanished.

## Sunlight Talisman
Medium for casting miracles of the Gods. The talisman of Solaire of Astora, the Knight of Sunlight, is decorated with a holy symbol, illustrated by Solaire himself. This talisman is a projection of Solaire's upstanding, unwavering faith.

## Balder Shield
Shield of the knights of the ancient kingdom of Balder. Tweaked for improved stability. Balder was the home of the Knight King Rendal, but the kingdom was reduced to ruins after a widespread outbreak of Undead.

## Sunlight Shield
Shield of Solaire of Astora, Knight of Sunlight. Decorated with a holy symbol, but Solaire illustrated it himself, and it has no divine powers of its own. As it turns out, Solaire's incredible prowess is a product of his own training, and nothing more.

## Black Knight Shield
Shield of the Black Knights that wander Lordan. A flowing canal is chiseled deeply into its face. Long ago, the black knights faced the chaos demons, and were charred black, but their shields became highly resistant to fire.

## Ring of Steel Protection
This ring belonged to the Knight King Rendal. It grants its wearer protection by boosting defense against physical attacks. Of the many legends surrounding the Knight King Rendal, one of the more well-known speaks of his standing down a giant drake and slashing it to pieces.

## White Seance Ring
A divine ring entrusted to the head bishop of the Way of White and apostle to Allfather Lloyd, uncle to Lord Gwyn. It grants additional attunement slots. The head bishop of the Way of White is the guardian of law and caste, and one of the great royals of Thorolund.

## Darkmoon Seance Ring
This ring is granted to adherents of Gwyndolin, Darkmoon deity and last born of Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight. Grants additional magic attunement slots. The Dark Sun Gwyndolin is the only remaining deity in Anor Londo. His followers are few, but their tasks are of vital importance.

## Ring of the Sun's Firstborn
Lord Gwyn's firstborn, who inherited the sunlight, once wore this ancient ring. Boosts the strength of miracles. Lord Gwyn's firstborn was a god of war, but his foolishness led to a loss of the annals, and rescinding of his deific status. Today, even his name is not known.

## Dark Wood Grain Ring
This special ring crafted in an Eastern land is made of gold, but with a wood grain crest on its surface. Agents of subterfuge in this faraway land are particularly fond of the dark gold wood grain, which greatly alters its wearer's rolling action.

## Calamity Ring
A ring enchanted by the orange eye of Kalameet, the bringer of calamity. Doubles damage received by its wearer. A useless ring befitting of no finger. Best left unknown, or at least well hidden.

## Armor of the Sun
Armor of Solaire of Astora, Knight of Sunlight. The large holy symbol of the Sun, while powerless, was painted by Solaire himself. Solaire's incredible prowess must have come from rigorous training alone, for his equipment exhibits no special traits.

## Brass Armor
Armor of the Darkmoon Knightess, Fire Keeper of Anor Londo. After becoming Undead, she visited the Dark Sun Gwyndolin at the Mausoleum of the Spiral Depths, became a Blade of the Darkmoon, and assumed the flame-keeping duty. She received this armor, which hides her hideous form and helps her hunt the guilty.

## Mask of the Sealer
Mask of the sorcerers who flooded New Londo to seal away the Darkwraiths, and the Four Kings who descended into Dark. It symbolizes their resolve to keep the seal shut forever and their atonement for all who were sacrificed, but two of the three forsook New Londo upon tiring of their duty.

## Mask of Velka
Mask worn by pardoners serving Velka, the Goddess of Sin. The pardoners listen to the confessions of sinners, urging reflection and salvation. Their masks symbolize separation from worldly desires.

## Robe of the Channelers
Robe of the Channelers, sorcerers that serve Seath the Scaleless. Even after the onset of Seath's madness, the "snatchers," as they were often called, ventured to far lands to find suitable human specimens.

## Painting Guardian Hood
Hood worn by the alabaster-clothed guardians of the paintings in Anor Londo. Offers ubstantial protection versus magic. They have guarded the Great Paintings of Ariamis for ages, passing their duty down through the generations, but the reason for doing so passed from all memory long ago.

## Helm of Favor
Helm of Lautrec the Embraced, representing the goddess Fina's love. During his solitude, he forsook everything, for he believed in the goddess' love for him.

## Embraced Armor of Favor
Armor of Lautrec the Embraced, representing the goddess Fina's love. The goddess' arms wrap around it, as if to embrace the wearer.

## Xanthous Crown
A mysterious item once worn by the Xanthous King Jeremiah, the legendary exile. No one knows where it came from. The crown bears high-quality cloth which is quite soft to the touch, but its bright yellow color stings the eyes, and it is clearly far too big.
